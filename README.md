# Copybara Sync Example Repo
This repo is an example on how to use [Copybara](https://github.com/google/copybara) to synchronize an OSS project (we'll use [Koboshi](https://github.com/wix/Koboshi) for this) and an internal repo containing a copy of the code.    
The current repo will be a synthetic version of an internal repo.
